# MultiQC observations:
The per base sequence content module failed, which could potentially be from low read depth. The GC content followed a normal distributions, which is what
was expected. In the Per Base N content module, it was seen that the N content was consitently low across all positions, which is a good quality indicator.
In the Sequence Duplication Levels Module, a high proportion of duplicates at levels >10x was observed. This could be due to sequencing reads originating 
from repetitive genomic regions, where short read lengths make it difficult to distinguish unique sequences. If the reads are not long enough to span unique
breakpoints within these regions, they may be incorrectly detected as duplicates. The Per Sequence Quality SCores modules shows that nearly all reads have high
Phred scores, indicating that the quality is generally very good across samples. Lastly, adapter content shows low levels of adapter contamination across samples,
indicating that adapter trimming is likely unnecessary or has already been performed before this workflow was commenced. 

Now onto the differential expression analysis. First, filter counts. This is done by removing genes with all zero counts, and keeping genes expressed 
in at least 3 samples with at least 1 count

```{r}
# Load the counts matrix, ensuring gene names are set as row names
counts <- read_csv("results/verse_concat.csv") %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "gene")  # Ensure gene names are used as row names

# Convert counts to numeric (in case they are read as characters)
counts <- counts %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric))

# Count genes before filtering
genes_before <- nrow(counts)

# Filtering step 1: Remove genes with all-zero counts
filtered_counts <- counts[rowSums(counts) > 0, ]

# Filtering step 2: Keep genes expressed in at least 3 samples with at least 1 count
filtered_counts <- filtered_counts[rowSums(filtered_counts > 1) >= 3, ]
```

Check how many genes present before and after filtering and visualize
```{r}
# Count genes after filtering
genes_after <- nrow(filtered_counts)

# Report results
cat("Genes before filtering:", genes_before, "\n")
cat("Genes after filtering:", genes_after, "\n")

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(log10(rowSums(counts) + 1), main="Before Filtering", xlab="Log10 Sum", col="steelblue")
hist(log10(rowSums(filtered_counts) + 1), main="After Filtering", xlab="Log10 Sum", col="darkred")
```

63241 genes were present before filtering, and now 28111 are present

Next, run DESeq2 on the filtered counts, convert ensembls to gene symbols, and output top 10 results. And write csv containing this table

```{r}
sample_info <- tibble(c("control_rep1", "control_rep2", "control_rep3", "exp_rep1", "exp_rep2", "exp_rep3"), condition = c("control", "control", "control", "exp", "exp", "exp"))

# Create DESeq2 dataset from filtered counts
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = filtered_counts, colData = sample_info, design = ~ condition)

# Run DESeq2 analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract results
res <- results(dds)

```


```{r}
# Convert results to dataframe and order by padj (adjusted p-value)
res_df <- as.data.frame(res) %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "gene") %>%
  arrange(padj)  # Sort by adjusted p-value (most significant first)

id_map <- read_tsv("results/id2name.txt", col_names = c("gene", "gene_name"))

res_df_named <- res_df %>%
  left_join(id_map, by = "gene") %>%
  mutate(gene_name = ifelse(is.na(gene_name), gene, gene_name))


# Select only the relevant columns (gene name, log2FoldChange, padj)
top10_genes_named <- res_df_named %>%
  arrange(padj) %>%
  head(10) %>%  # Use head() instead of slice()
  select(gene_name, padj)  # Keep only relevant columns

# Save updated top 10 genes table
write_csv(top10_genes_named, "top10_significant_genes_named.csv")
```

A padj threshold was determined, and the signicant genes were output into a list 

```{r}
# next, select a p value threshold and report the number of genes that meet the criterion
padj_threshold <- 0.05

num_significant_genes <- sum(res_df_named$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)

#report the results
cat("Number of significant genes at padj <", padj_threshold, ":", num_significant_genes, "\n")

# Extract significant genes (padj < 0.05)
significant_genes <- res_df_named %>%
  filter(padj < 0.05) %>%
  pull(gene_name)  # Extract only gene names

# Save list as a text file (one gene per line)
write_lines(significant_genes, "significant_genes_list.txt")

head(significant_genes, 10)

```

Next, DAVID was run on these 1189 significant genes.

# DAVID Analysis

After performing DAVID enrichment analysis on our 1,143 (some were not included due to inability to finding matching gene symbols
for the ensembl ids) significant genes (padj < 0.05), we identified key biological processes, 
cellular components, and molecular functions that are overrepresented in our dataset. These results provide insights into the 
potential roles of differentially expressed genes and their involvement in various cellular activities.

In the Biological Process (BP) category, we observed significant enrichment in pathways related to apoptosis, cell adhesion, 
migration, proliferation, and hypoxia response. Notably, the apoptotic process (p = 1.6e-5) was highly enriched, suggesting 
that many of the differentially expressed genes are involved in cell death regulation. Additionally, the response to hypoxia 
(p = 4.8e-6) was significantly enriched, indicating potential oxygen-related stress responses. Other notable processes 
include cell adhesion (p = 8.2e-9) and extracellular matrix organization (p = 3.5e-8), both of which are critical for tissue 
remodeling, metastasis, and cell communication. Furthermore, positive regulation of cell population proliferation (p = 4.3e-7) 
suggests possible involvement in growth signaling pathways, including those related to cancer progression.

The Cellular Component (CC) enrichment analysis revealed that many of the significant genes are associated with membranes, 
extracellular structures, and synaptic regions. The most highly enriched component was the plasma membrane (p = 8.6e-15), 
suggesting that a substantial number of differentially expressed genes are membrane-associated and potentially involved in 
signaling pathways. The extracellular matrix (p = 1.4e-6) was also highly significant, reinforcing the idea that these genes 
play a role in cell adhesion, tissue organization, and intercellular communication. Interestingly, several synapse-related terms 
were enriched, such as glutamatergic synapse (p = 7.7e-7) and GABAergic synapse (p = 2.9e-5), indicating a potential role for 
these genes in neuronal signaling and synaptic activity.

The Molecular Function (MF) analysis highlighted enrichment in protein binding, receptor activity, and ion binding functions. 
The most significant term was calcium ion binding (p = 9.0e-11), suggesting involvement in calcium-mediated signaling pathways, 
which are crucial for processes such as signal transduction, muscle contraction, and neurotransmission. Additionally, protein 
homodimerization activity (p = 1.5e-6) was enriched, indicating that many of the differentially expressed genes are involved in 
protein-protein interactions. Integrin binding (p = 3.6e-4) was another key term, reinforcing the role of cell adhesion and 
extracellular signaling. Finally, DNA-binding transcription repressor activity (p = 6.4e-4) suggests that some of these genes 
may be involved in transcriptional regulation and gene expression control.

Overall, these findings indicate that the differentially expressed genes in this dataset are significantly associated with apoptosis,
hypoxia response, and cell adhesion, processes that are essential for cell survival, stress adaptation, and tissue remodeling. The 
enrichment of membrane-associated and extracellular matrix components suggests that these genes play key roles in intercellular 
communication and signaling, while the molecular function analysis points to strong involvement in calcium signaling, protein 
interactions, and transcriptional regulation. These results provide important insights into the biological implications of the 
differential expression patterns observed in our dataset.

Next, DESeq normalization was performed using vst 

```{r}
# Apply variance stabilizing transformation
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = FALSE)

head(assay(vsd), 3)
```

PCA was then performed on the normalized counts

```{r}
plotPCA(vsd, intgroup=c("condition"))
```

Next, a heatmap was generated to visualize the the sample to sample distances for
this experiment

```{r}
library(pheatmap)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Compute Euclidean distance between samples
sample_dists <- dist(t(assay(vsd)))  # Rows are samples

# Convert to a matrix (pheatmap requires matrix input)
sample_dist_matrix <- as.matrix(sample_dists)

# Create the heatmap
pheatmap(sample_dist_matrix,
         clustering_distance_rows = sample_dists,
         clustering_distance_cols = sample_dists,
         color = colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(9, "Blues")))(255),
         main = "Sample-to-Sample Distance Heatmap")
```

The PCA plot shows a clear separation between the control and experimental groups, with PC1 (86% of the 
variance) driving most of the difference in gene expression. This indicates that the experimental 
condition is the primary source of variation in the dataset. The control samples cluster closely at 
the negative side of PC1, whereas two of the experimental replicates cluster together at the positive 
side. Notably, one experimental replicate positions itself away from the other two, suggesting possible 
variability within the experimental group—whether due to biological differences, technical variation, or 
batch effects. Overall, the clustering patterns confirm good consistency among the biological replicates 
within each group, but the outlier may merit further investigation.

The sample-to-sample distance heatmap reinforces these findings by showing that control samples 
are more similar to each other (low Euclidean distance), while experimental samples form a 
separate cluster with higher distances from controls. The hierarchical clustering confirms 
the distinct grouping of the two conditions, further supporting the notion that the treatment 
has a strong impact on gene expression. Additionally, exp_rep3 appears slightly different from 
the other experimental replicates, consistent with the PCA results. This may indicate variability 
in response to the treatment or technical differences in sequencing depth or batch effects. 
Overall, these analyses confirm the biological relevance of the experiment while also highlighting
a potential outlier that should be further examined.

Next, a fgsea will be performed

```{r}
res_df_named_unique <- res_df_named %>%
  arrange(desc(log2FoldChange)) %>%
  drop_na(log2FoldChange) %>%
  distinct(gene_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

ranked_genes <- res_df_named_unique %>% 
  pull(log2FoldChange, gene_name)
```

Load in pathways
```{r}
pathways <- fgsea::gmtPathways('c2.cp.v2024.1.Hs.symbols.gmt')
```

Run the FGSEA
```{r}
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
fgsea_results <- fgsea(pathways = pathways, 
                       stats = ranked_genes, 
                       minSize = 15,  # Minimum genes in a pathway
                       maxSize = 500) # Maximum genes in a pathway

fgsea_results <- fgsea_results %>% as_tibble()
```

Filter the significant pathways
```{r}
# Choose a significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.05)
fgsea_sig <- fgsea_results %>% 
  filter(padj < 0.05) %>% 
  arrange(padj)
```

```{r}
fgsea_results %>% filter(NES < 0) %>% arrange(padj)
fgsea_results %>% filter(NES > 0) %>% arrange(padj)
```

Visualize the top pathways
```{r}
# Identify the top 10 positively enriched and top 10 negatively enriched pathways
pos_paths <- fgsea_results %>% 
  slice_max(NES, n = 10) %>% 
  pull(pathway)

neg_paths <- fgsea_results %>% 
  slice_min(NES, n = 10) %>% 
  pull(pathway)

# Filter to those pathways, convert them to factors, and tidy up the names
plot_data <- fgsea_results %>% 
  filter(pathway %in% c(pos_paths, neg_paths)) %>%
  mutate(
    # Make 'pathway' a factor
    pathway = factor(pathway),
    # Create a separate label that replaces underscores with spaces
    label = str_replace_all(pathway, "_", " ")
  )

# Build the bar chart
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = fct_reorder(label, NES), y = NES, fill = NES > 0)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "red", "FALSE" = "blue")) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +
  labs(
    title = "fgsea results for C2 MSigDB gene sets",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Normalized Enrichment Score (NES)"
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 80))
```

Here you can see that several positively enriched pathways (red bars) center on growth factor (IGF1/IGF1R) and mTOR signaling, extracellular matrix assembly (collagen), and p53‐related pathways—processes generally involved in cell proliferation, survival, and tissue structure. It’s also interesting that heart development and integrin‐mediated adhesion pathways appear at the top, suggesting potential changes in tissue remodeling or cardiovascular‐related processes.

On the negatively enriched side (blue bars), there is an emphasis on pathways controlling translation machinery (including SARS‐CoV‐related modulation of translation) and neuronal/β‐cell function (e.g., GLP1 secretion, dopaminergic pathways, and beta‐cell development). These results could indicate that while proliferative and survival signaling are upregulated, certain metabolic and neuronal regulatory pathways might be comparatively downregulated in these samples.

```{r}
selected <- c('ELMO1', 'PAK3', 'INSM1', 'NEUROG3', 'GAB2', 'NOS3', 'PAX6', 'NEUROD1', 'ONECUT1', 'KRAS', 'LAMB2', 'SPP1', 'DUSP6', 'SPRY2', 'PLAT', 'AKT3', 'SLC2A2', 'BAX', 'COL2A1', 'APOE', 'LAMA4', 'KDR', 'PGF', 'PTPRU', 'COL9A2', 'NTRK2')

labeled_results <- res_df_named_unique %>%
  mutate(label = ifelse(gene_name %in% selected, TRUE, FALSE))

```


# DE Results Comparison
In the paper, they found 319 genes were up regulated and 412 were down regulated in TYK2 KO cells compared to wildtype.  

```{r}
library(dplyr)

sig_genes <- res_df_named_unique %>%
  filter(padj < 0.05) %>%
  mutate(direction = ifelse(log2FoldChange > 0, "Up", "Down"))

sig_counts <- sig_genes %>%
  group_by(direction) %>%
  summarise(n = n())

sig_counts
```
Using the same padj threshold and no log2FC threshold, my results showed 531 genes up regulated, and 657 were down regulated


# Enrichment Results Comparison
Our enrichment analyses show similar overarching biological themes across the different methods. Both the paper’s fgsea analysis and my DAVID/GSEA analysis point to disruptions in pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and endocrine development. For example, the paper reported significant alterations in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and gene sets associated with β-cell development, which are in line with the trends observed in my analyses. This consistency suggests that the key biological processes affected by TYK2 perturbation are robust across different enrichment approaches.

However, there are also notable differences in the details of the enrichment results. The paper primarily used Reactome gene sets, while DAVID and GSEA analyses rely on different databases such as KEGG and GO, which can lead to variations in the specific pathways identified as significant. Additionally, methodological differences—GSEA being a rank-based method that considers the entire gene list versus DAVID’s cutoff-based approach—result in discrepancies in pathway ranking, statistical significance, and the overall number of enriched pathways. These differences underscore how the choice of gene set collection and analytical strategy can influence the interpretation of the underlying biology.

# Methods

Pipeline Implementation and Execution
The RNA-seq analysis was implemented using a custom Nextflow pipeline (Nextflow v24.04.2), which orchestrates modular processes for reproducible analysis. The pipeline is defined in a series of Nextflow modules managed via the nextflow.config file, ensuring consistent software environments.

Quality Control and Preprocessing
Raw sequencing reads were initially assessed for quality using FastQC (v0.12.1). Quality control reports were then aggregated with MultiQC (v1.25) to generate an overall summary of read quality. Reads passing quality control were used in subsequent steps.

Gene Annotation and STAR Index Construction
Gene annotations were parsed from a provided GTF file using a dedicated GTF_PARSE module. A STAR index was then generated from the GRCh38 reference genome and the parsed GTF annotations (STAR v2.7.11b), which prepares the reference for efficient alignment.

Alignment and Quantification
Quality-filtered reads were aligned to the indexed reference genome using the STAR alignment (STAR v2.7.11b). Aligned reads were then quantified at the gene level using VERSE (v0.1.5), which counts reads mapping to genomic features based on the provided GTF file. The count files from individual samples were concatenated using the CONCAT module to produce a comprehensive count matrix.

Differential Expression and Functional Enrichment
Gene counts were subsequently imported into R (v4.4.0) for differential expression analysis using DESeq2. Genes with an adjusted p-value < 0.05 were deemed significantly differentially expressed, with upregulation and downregulation defined by the sign of the log₂ fold change. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on the significant gene set using fgsea and DAVID, comparing against gene set collections from Reactome, KEGG, and GO. Enriched pathways were considered significant based on an adjusted p-value threshold of < 0.05.

Visualization and Reporting
Final data visualizations—including PCA plots, volcano plots, and enrichment bar charts—were generated in an R Markdown report using ggplot2 and dplyr. These visualizations provided insights into differential gene expression and pathway enrichment, and facilitated direct comparisons with published results.

Reproducibility and Environment Management
The Nextflow pipeline ensured reproducibility by executing each module within containerized environments as specified in the configuration file. This approach guaranteed that all processes (FastQC, MultiQC, STAR, VERSE, etc.) ran with the intended versions and parameters across different computational platforms.

# Project 1 - Discussion Questions
These questions are meant to help me assess how well I’ve conveyed some of the
material as well as challenge you to think conceptually about some of the
underlying science. Some of the questions have a definitive "right" answer while
some of them are more open-ended and I'm just looking for your thought process
and interpretation. All of these questions can be answered in a few sentences so
do your best to be concise.

Please copy these questions into your single Rmd or notebook that you've been 
working on your DE analysis. All of your analyses, writing, and answers to these
questions should be in a single notebook. 


## RNAseq

1. List the major high-level steps of a basic RNAseq experiment to look for
differentially expressed genes. At each step, list what data you need to perform
each step and what format they are in (if applicable). At minimum, there are 4
essential steps.

Total RNA is extracted from biological samples and converted into cDNA libraries suitable
for sequencing. The cDNA libraries are sequenced using a high-throughput platform to
generate raw reads in FASTQ format.The raw reads are aligned to a reference genome or
transcriptome to produce count data in formats like BAM or count matrices.Gene or
transcript counts are statistically analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes
using tools like DESeq2 or edgeR.

1. Extraction and library preparation
2. Sequencing
3. Read alignment and transcript quantification
4. DE analysis



2. Consider the following FastQC plot.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("fastqc_plot.png")
```


2a. What aspect of the data does this plot show?

This plot shows the per-sequence GC content in an RNA-seq dataset compared to a theoretical
normal distribution. This helps assess whether GC content across reads is consistent with
expectations.


2b. Make an interpretation of this plot assuming the data type was RNASeq.

This plot shows two distinct peaks, and one that deviates greatly from the expected
GC content. This could be a sign of a presence of contaminating sequences (such as rRNA).


2c. Do you think this plot indicates there was a problem with the dataset?
Explain your answer.

This pattern suggests the presence of contaminants, biases in library prep, or technical
artifacts, all of which can affect downstream analyses like expression quantification.
with that being said, this likely indicates a problem with the dataset.


2d. Make a hypothesis about what the problem represents. Outline a bioinformatics
strategy that would enable you to confirm your hypothesis. 

I would predict that these high GC content reads are coming from rRNA contamination.
To see if this is the case, I would separate reads based on GC content using a custom
script or by using tools in Biopython. Then, I would BLAST these sequences to a reference
rRNA database to check for rRNA contamination.


3. What is a splice-aware aligner? When is it important to use a splice-aware
aligner?

A splice-aware aligner is a tool that can align RNA-seq reads across exon-exon junctions,
recognizing that parts of a read may map to separate, non-contiguous regions of the genome
due to splicing. It's important to use a splice-aware aligner when aligning RNA-seq data to
a reference genome because RNA-seq reads often span spliced introns, and non-splice-aware
aligners would misalign or discard such reads.


4. What does a “gene-level” count as produced by VERSE or any other counting
tool in a RNAseq experiment represent?

A gene-level count represents the number of sequencing reads that have been uniquely
assigned to a specific gene based on how well they align to that gene’s exonic regions.

VERSE maps aligned reads to annotated gene features from a GTF file, and sums up the reads
that overlap exons for each gene. This provides a measure of gene expression that can 
be used in downstrad analyses like DE.



5. In your own words, briefly describe what information the matching GTF for a
reference genome stores.

A Gene Transfer Format file contains detailed annotations for a reference genome. This
includes locations of genes, exons, and other genomic features. This information enables
accurate mapping of RNA-seq reads to specific transcripts during alignment and
quantification


6. When counting alignments using VERSE or any other utility, why do we need to
provide the matching reference genome GTF file?

We need to provide the matching GTF file to ensure that the counting tool knows where the
genes, exons, and transcripts are located on the genome. This ensures precise gene-level
quantification for downstream analysis like DE


7. Let’s pretend that this was a GSEA result from an experiment where we treated
293T cells with a drug and compared changes in gene expression to wild-type
cells treated with a vehicle control. The differential expression results are
relative to the control cells (i.e. a positive fold change means a gene is
upregulated upon treatment with the drug)

Assume the following result is statistically significant with a positive NES
(normalized enrichment score) and that it represents a GSEA experiment performed
on the entire list of genes discovered in the experiment ranked by
log2FoldChange (i.e. genes that are “upregulated” in the cells treated with drug
are on the “left” and genes that are “downregulated” due to treatment are on the
“right”).

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("gsea_plot.png")
```


7a. Form a valid interpretation / conclusion of the results shown in the plot
given the above setup.

The positive enrichment score peaking early and the concentration of vertical black bars
(hits) bear thge top-ranked genes indicate that many of the genes involved in the acute
inflammatory response are upregulated in response to the drug.



7b. Now consider that all of the genes driving the enrichment are all activators
of the inflammatory pathway. Does your interpretation change and if so, how?

I would say that this would strengthen my interpretation. This is because if they are all
activators, that the drug is likely activating the pathway itself. This is because
activator genes directly drive the pathway's function. This implies a functional induction
of inflammation in the sample cell by the drug as opposed to a secondary effect.


7c. Finally, consider that all of the genes driving the enrichment all function
to inhibit inflammation. Does your interpretation change and if so, how?

My interpretation changes significantly if this is the case. This suggests that the
upregulation that the drug could be triggering a negative regulatory response,
potentially supressing inflammation. This means that the direction of the biological effect
is different even though the gene set is still enriched.

8. Rank the following quality control metrics for a 2x100nt paired-end illumina 
mRNAseq dataset from most concerning to least concerning. Provide a brief
statement on where you ranked each and why. Assume that the data has not been
processed and was provided as-is from the sequencing machine. 

- Unequal Read Lengths
- Average PHRED score < 20 in the last 10 bases
- 15% of reads have identical sequences
- 50% of reads are multimapped after alignment to the appro
priate genome
- 10% of reads are unmapped after alignment to the appropriate genome
- Non-random nucleotide distribution in the first 6 bases
- Nucleotide frequencies of ACTG are not equal over the entire read
- Unequal number of forward and reverse reads

1. Unequal read lengths
This is the most concerning, as it could indicate a sequencing or instrument error,
as we would expect inform read lengths in an 2x100nt illumina paired-end run.

2. Average PHRED score < 20 in the last 10 bases
I chose this as the most detrimental because low base quality near the 3' end can lead
to high error rates and misalignments. Trimming or filtering will be necessary

3. 50% of reads are multimapped after alignment to the appropriate genome
I chose this as the second most concercing because having 50% multimapped can make
gene assignment diffiult and can potentially distort expression estimates.

4. 15% of reads have identical sequences
This level of duplication suggests PCR over-amplification or adapter/contaminant sequences. If unaddressed, it can bias expression analysis.

5. Non-random nucleotide distribution in the first 6 bases
This could indicate adapter biases or primier biases that cna be handled using adapter
trimming.

6. Unequal number of forward and reverse reads
This can arise if reads are of different qualities and are filtered more often than the other

7. 10% of reads are unmapped after alignment to the appropriate genome
While unmapped reads can indicate contamination or poor library quality, a 10% rate is relatively low and may not significantly affect overall results

8. Nucleotide frequencies of ACTG are not equal over the entire read
Some imbalance is common in RNA-seq due to transcript composition and library prep. A mild skew won’t necessarily ruin alignment or quantification unless it’s extreme.
