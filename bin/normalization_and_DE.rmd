MultiQC observations:
The per base sequence content module failed, which could potentially be from low read depth. The GC content followed a normal distributions, which is what
was expected. In the Per Base N content module, it was seen that the N content was consitently low across all positions, which is a good quality indicator.
In the Sequence Duplication Levels Module, a high proportion of duplicates at levels >10x was observed. This could be due to sequencing reads originating 
from repetitive genomic regions, where short read lengths make it difficult to distinguish unique sequences. If the reads are not long enough to span unique
breakpoints within these regions, they may be incorrectly detected as duplicates. The Per Sequence Quality SCores modules shows that nearly all reads have high
Phred scores, indicating that the quality is generally very good across samples. Lastly, adapter content shows low levels of adapter contamination across samples,
indicating that adapter trimming is likely unnecessary or has already been performed before this workflow was commenced. 

Now onto the differential expression analysis. First, filter counts. This is done by removing genes with all zero counts, and keeping genes expressed 
in at least 3 samples with at least 1 count

```{r}
# Load the counts matrix, ensuring gene names are set as row names
counts <- read_csv("results/verse_concat.csv") %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "gene")  # Ensure gene names are used as row names

# Convert counts to numeric (in case they are read as characters)
counts <- counts %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric))

# Count genes before filtering
genes_before <- nrow(counts)

# Filtering step 1: Remove genes with all-zero counts
filtered_counts <- counts[rowSums(counts) > 0, ]

# Filtering step 2: Keep genes expressed in at least 3 samples with at least 1 count
filtered_counts <- filtered_counts[rowSums(filtered_counts > 1) >= 3, ]
```

Check how many genes present before and after filtering and visualize
```{r}
# Count genes after filtering
genes_after <- nrow(filtered_counts)

# Report results
cat("Genes before filtering:", genes_before, "\n")
cat("Genes after filtering:", genes_after, "\n")

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(log10(rowSums(counts) + 1), main="Before Filtering", xlab="Log10 Sum", col="steelblue")
hist(log10(rowSums(filtered_counts) + 1), main="After Filtering", xlab="Log10 Sum", col="darkred")
```

63241 genes were present before filtering, and now 28111 are present

Next, run DESeq2 on the filtered counts, convert ensembls to gene symbols, and output top 10 results. And write csv containing this table

```{r}
sample_info <- data.frame(
  row.names = colnames(filtered_counts),
  condition = c("control", "control", "control", "exp", "exp", "exp")  # Adjust based on samples
)

# Ensure 'condition' is a factor (not character)
sample_info$condition <- as.factor(sample_info$condition)

# Create DESeq2 dataset from filtered counts
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = filtered_counts, colData = sample_info, design = ~ condition)

# Run DESeq2 analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract results
res <- results(dds)

```


```{r}
# Convert results to dataframe and order by padj (adjusted p-value)
res_df <- as.data.frame(res) %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "gene") %>%
  arrange(padj)  # Sort by adjusted p-value (most significant first)

id_map <- read_tsv("results/id2name.txt", col_names = c("gene", "gene_name"))

res_df_named <- res_df %>%
  left_join(id_map, by = "gene") %>%
  mutate(gene_name = ifelse(is.na(gene_name), gene, gene_name))


# Select only the relevant columns (gene name, log2FoldChange, padj)
top10_genes_named <- res_df_named %>%
  arrange(padj) %>%
  head(10) %>%  # Use head() instead of slice()
  select(gene_name, padj)  # Keep only relevant columns

# Save updated top 10 genes table
write_csv(top10_genes_named, "top10_significant_genes_named.csv")
```

A padj threshold was determined, and the signicant genes were output into a list 

```{r}
# next, select a p value threshold and report the number of genes that meet the criterion
padj_threshold <- 0.05

num_significant_genes <- sum(res_df_named$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)

#report the results
cat("Number of significant genes at padj <", padj_threshold, ":", num_significant_genes, "\n")

# Extract significant genes (padj < 0.05)
significant_genes <- res_df_named %>%
  filter(padj < 0.05) %>%
  pull(gene_name)  # Extract only gene names

# Save list as a text file (one gene per line)
write_lines(significant_genes, "significant_genes_list.txt")

cat("Significant genes saved to significant_genes_list.txt\n")
```

Next, DAVID was run on these 1189 significant genes.

After performing DAVID enrichment analysis on our 1,143 (some were not included due to inability to finding matching gene symbols
for the ensembl ids) significant genes (padj < 0.05), we identified key biological processes, 
cellular components, and molecular functions that are overrepresented in our dataset. These results provide insights into the 
potential roles of differentially expressed genes and their involvement in various cellular activities.

In the Biological Process (BP) category, we observed significant enrichment in pathways related to apoptosis, cell adhesion, 
migration, proliferation, and hypoxia response. Notably, the apoptotic process (p = 1.6e-5) was highly enriched, suggesting 
that many of the differentially expressed genes are involved in cell death regulation. Additionally, the response to hypoxia 
(p = 4.8e-6) was significantly enriched, indicating potential oxygen-related stress responses. Other notable processes 
include cell adhesion (p = 8.2e-9) and extracellular matrix organization (p = 3.5e-8), both of which are critical for tissue 
remodeling, metastasis, and cell communication. Furthermore, positive regulation of cell population proliferation (p = 4.3e-7) 
suggests possible involvement in growth signaling pathways, including those related to cancer progression.

The Cellular Component (CC) enrichment analysis revealed that many of the significant genes are associated with membranes, 
extracellular structures, and synaptic regions. The most highly enriched component was the plasma membrane (p = 8.6e-15), 
suggesting that a substantial number of differentially expressed genes are membrane-associated and potentially involved in 
signaling pathways. The extracellular matrix (p = 1.4e-6) was also highly significant, reinforcing the idea that these genes 
play a role in cell adhesion, tissue organization, and intercellular communication. Interestingly, several synapse-related terms 
were enriched, such as glutamatergic synapse (p = 7.7e-7) and GABAergic synapse (p = 2.9e-5), indicating a potential role for 
these genes in neuronal signaling and synaptic activity.

The Molecular Function (MF) analysis highlighted enrichment in protein binding, receptor activity, and ion binding functions. 
The most significant term was calcium ion binding (p = 9.0e-11), suggesting involvement in calcium-mediated signaling pathways, 
which are crucial for processes such as signal transduction, muscle contraction, and neurotransmission. Additionally, protein 
homodimerization activity (p = 1.5e-6) was enriched, indicating that many of the differentially expressed genes are involved in 
protein-protein interactions. Integrin binding (p = 3.6e-4) was another key term, reinforcing the role of cell adhesion and 
extracellular signaling. Finally, DNA-binding transcription repressor activity (p = 6.4e-4) suggests that some of these genes 
may be involved in transcriptional regulation and gene expression control.

Overall, these findings indicate that the differentially expressed genes in this dataset are significantly associated with apoptosis,
hypoxia response, and cell adhesion, processes that are essential for cell survival, stress adaptation, and tissue remodeling. The 
enrichment of membrane-associated and extracellular matrix components suggests that these genes play key roles in intercellular 
communication and signaling, while the molecular function analysis points to strong involvement in calcium signaling, protein 
interactions, and transcriptional regulation. These results provide important insights into the biological implications of the 
differential expression patterns observed in our dataset.

Next, DESeq normalization was performed using vst 

```{r}
# Apply variance stabilizing transformation
vsd <- rlog(dds, blind = FALSE)

head(assay(vsd), 3)

# Extract normalized counts
normalized_counts <- assay(vsd)
```

PCA was then performed on the normalized counts

```{r}
pca_matrix <- t(normalized_counts)
```

```{r}
# Transpose the normalized counts matrix (PCA requires samples as rows)
pca_data <- prcomp(pca_matrix, scale. = FALSE)

# Extract PCA results
pca_df <- as.data.frame(pca_data$x)
pca_df$Sample <- rownames(pca_df)  # Add sample names

# Add condition labels (modify accordingly)
pca_df$Condition <- ifelse(grepl("control", pca_df$Sample), "Control", "Experiment")

# View PCA variance explained
print(summary(pca_data))

```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Condition, label = Sample)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_text(vjust = -1) +
  labs(title = "PCA of RNA-seq Data",
       x = paste0("PC1: ", round(100 * summary(pca_data)$importance[2,1], 2), "% Variance"),
       y = paste0("PC2: ", round(100 * summary(pca_data)$importance[2,2], 2), "% Variance")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

print(p)
```

Next, a heatmap was generated to visualize the the sample to sample distances for
this experiment

```{r}
library(pheatmap)

# Compute Euclidean distance between samples
sample_dists <- dist(pca_matrix)  # Rows are samples

# Convert to a matrix (pheatmap requires matrix input)
sample_dist_matrix <- as.matrix(sample_dists)

# Create the heatmap
pheatmap(sample_dist_matrix,
         clustering_distance_rows = "euclidean",
         clustering_distance_cols = "euclidean",
         clustering_method = "complete",
         color = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(50),
         main = "Sample-to-Sample Distance Heatmap")dfdoes
```

The PCA plot reveals a clear separation between the control and experimental groups, indicating 
that the treatment has a significant effect on gene expression. PC1, which explains 62.7% of 
the variance, primarily drives this separation, suggesting that the experimental condition is 
the dominant source of variability in the dataset. The clustering of control samples together and 
experimental samples together confirms that the biological replicates are consistent within 
each condition. However, exp_rep3 appears slightly distant from exp_rep1 and exp_rep2, suggesting
potential variability within the experimental group. This could be due to biological differences,
technical variation, or batch effects and may warrant further investigation.

The sample-to-sample distance heatmap reinforces these findings by showing that control samples 
are more similar to each other (low Euclidean distance), while experimental samples form a 
separate cluster with higher distances from controls. The hierarchical clustering confirms 
the distinct grouping of the two conditions, further supporting the notion that the treatment 
has a strong impact on gene expression. Additionally, exp_rep3 appears slightly different from 
the other experimental replicates, consistent with the PCA results. This may indicate variability 
in response to the treatment or technical differences in sequencing depth or batch effects. 
Overall, these analyses confirm the biological relevance of the experiment while also highlighting
a potential outlier that should be further examined.

Next, a fgsea will be 

```{r}
# Load DESeq2 results
results_df <- as.data.frame(res)  # Ensure it contains log2FoldChange and p-value

results_df <- results_df %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "Ensembl_ID") #this converts the rownames to a real column (6 -> columns)

id_2_map <- read_tsv('id2name.txt', col_names = c("Ensembl_ID", "Gene_Symbol"))

results_df <- results_df %>%
  left_join(id_2_map, by = "Ensembl_ID")

results_df <- results_df %>%
  select(Gene_Symbol, everything()) %>%
  filter(!grepl("^ENSG", Gene_Symbol)) %>%
  select(-Ensembl_ID) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(log2FoldChange))) %>%
  distinct(Gene_Symbol, .keep_all = TRUE)


ranked_genes <- setNames(results_df$log2FoldChange, results_df$Gene_Symbol)

```

Next, get the C2 canonical pathways from msigdb
```{r}
pathways <- msigdbr(species = "Homo sapiens", category = "C2") %>%
  split(x = .$gene_symbol, f = .$gs_name)
```

Run the FGSEA
```{r}
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
fgsea_results <- fgsea(pathways = pathways, 
                       stats = ranked_genes, 
                       minSize = 10,  # Minimum genes in a pathway
                       maxSize = 1000) # Maximum genes in a pathway
```

Filter the significant pathways
```{r}
# Choose a significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.05)
fgsea_sig <- fgsea_results %>% 
  filter(padj < 0.05) %>% 
  arrange(padj)
```

Visualize the top pathways
```{r}
ggplot(fgsea_sig[1:10, ], aes(reorder(pathway, NES), NES, fill = padj)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "red", high = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Top Enriched Pathways (FGSEA)",
       x = "Pathway",
       y = "Normalized Enrichment Score (NES)")
```

The FGSEA results reveal significant downregulation of p53 target genes (FISCHER_DIRECT_P53_TARGETS_META_ANALYSIS), suggesting a potential suppression of
p53-mediated tumor suppression or stress response pathways. Additionally, multiple pathways related to H3K27me3-associated gene silencing
(MEISSNER_NPC_HCP_WITH_H3K4ME2_AND_H3K27ME3, MIKKELSEN_HCP_WITH_H3K27ME3) are enriched, indicating possible epigenetic regulation changes affecting gene
expression. The downregulation of the REACTOME_NEURONAL_SYSTEM pathway suggests potential neurodevelopmental or neuronal signaling alterations, which could
be relevant depending on the experimental context. The NABA_MATRISOME pathway, linked to extracellular matrix components, may indicate changes in cell
adhesion, migration, or tissue remodeling. Overall, these results suggest a coordinated biological shift involving tumor suppression, chromatin remodeling,
and cellular structure, warranting further investigation into the key genes driving these pathways.
